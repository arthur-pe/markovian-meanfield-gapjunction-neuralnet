Extension of auxiliary process of "Hydrodynamic Limit for Interacting Neurons" by A. Masi et al., (2015)

This is a markov process version of integrate and fire with gap junctions.

I extend their work with :
  -Leaky term, to avoid infinite memory issues
  -Simulations of multi regions interactions
  
Requires: numpy, matplotlib
